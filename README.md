# remote_switch_solar_panel
Welcome to my Source Code for this project that I worked on to run a TCP/IP client and server communication over Wifi.
I used Java in Android Studio, to create the client side of the tcp/ip network, creating a Socket and outputing a string value
"OFF" or "ON" (based on the ToggleButton's status) to the Socket, which the server would receive and know whether to turn the switch on or off.

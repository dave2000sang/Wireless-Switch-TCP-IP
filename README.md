# Remote_switch_solar_panel

Welcome to my Source Code for this project that I worked on to run a TCP/IP client and server communication over Wifi.
I used Java in Android Studio, to create the client side of the tcp/ip network, creating a Socket and outputing a string value
based on the ToggleButton's status to the Socket, which the server would receive and know whether to turn the switch on or off.

### The following image shows the battery, the raspberry board with the Relay Switch and a signal converter, and a solar converter, all packed into one small box

### Here is the solar panel that powers the battery through the solar converter.

The following is an image of a screenshot on my phone, showing the GUI of the switch.
